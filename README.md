# **Power BI Learning Journey & Projects**

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio! This repository contains projects that demonstrate my skills and growth in data visualization, data analysis, and business intelligence using Power BI.

Throughout my learning journey, I have focused on data modeling, creating interactive dashboards, and mastering DAX formulas to extract meaningful insights from data. These projects showcase practical applications of Power BI to solve real-world problems and support data-driven decision making.
