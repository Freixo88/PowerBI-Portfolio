Welcome to my Power BI portfolio! This repository showcases my progress and projects in data visualization, data modeling, and business intelligence using Power BI.

Throughout my learning journey, I have developed skills in creating interactive dashboards, writing DAX formulas, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decisions. Each project reflects my commitment to mastering Power BI and applying it to practical problems.

Feel free to explore the projects and connect with me for collaboration or discussion about data and visualization!
