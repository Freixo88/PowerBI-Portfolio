Welcome to my Power BI portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my growing expertise in data visualization, analysis, and business intelligence using Power BI. Through hands-on experience and continuous learning, I have developed skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

My goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive informed decision-making. This portfolio reflects my commitment to mastering Power BI and applying it to solve real-world problems across different datasets and industries.
